# DeepMarketModel
Deep learning models for predicting wholesale electricity price from fundamental price drivers.
We explore using RNN, LSTM, and GRU encoder-decoder models to estimate electricity prices from total electricity demand, natural gas price, and wind and solar power production.
This will be used in techno-economic analyses of novel energy systems to estimate revenue as the system operates in deregulated electricity markets.
At present, this study focuses on the CAISO, ERCOT, and MISO markets in the United States, though it is extensible to other markets internationally.
